## 📛 Errors that you can get
___There are no realy errors in adskit___, sometimes you will get 'nothing to show :(' into your ad page because there are any ads into our system.

_Response exemple_:
```
Ad Title: there is nothing to show :(
Ad Description: there is nothing to show :( -  Powered by AdsKit
```
# 💻 How many money/clicks

**AdsKit** provide €0.0030/clicks.
-> There is a limitation user/ads, if your user click more than 2 times on the same ad, you'll receive €0.00.

## 💦 Min. & Max. money withdraw

I’m an individual dev. and I don’t have a lot of money.
The minimum withdrawal is €0.20 and the maximum is €2.
I know, it’s not much, but this is just the beginning of AdsKit, if in the future more advertisers are interested in the project, this limitation will surely be high because I will win more money.
